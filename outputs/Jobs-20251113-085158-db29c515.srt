1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
[Speaker 00] Hi, I'm Rhea. Thank you for coming to interview with us today. Let's just go ahead and get

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,280
[Speaker 00] started with a quick introduction. Could you tell me a little bit about yourself?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,200
[Speaker 00] Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thank you so much for having me. It's an honor to be here.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,680
[Speaker 00] So I've been about myself. I'm originally from Morocco, where I lived pretty much my whole

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,920
[Speaker 00] life. I then came to Boston and studied industrial engineering at Northeastern University.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
[Speaker 00] While I was in college, I did a few different internships. I did technical ones at a local

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,680
[Speaker 00] power plant and at Amazon Robotics. And I also did one in consulting at the Boston Consulting Group

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,560
[Speaker 00] and was also the president of the consulting club at my university. So really I'm someone who

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,080
[Speaker 00] enjoys both the business side of things, but I also do have a passion for technology.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,040
[Speaker 00] So down the line, my goal is to start my own education technology company in my home

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,920
[Speaker 00] country, Morocco, so I can make education more affordable through the use of tech. And

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,560
[Speaker 00] outside of school and work, I also do magic tricks on college campuses.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,840
[Speaker 00] Oh wow, that sounds like a very impressive background.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,160
[Speaker 00] So why exactly are you interested in interviewing with our consulting firm?

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,160
[Speaker 00] Yeah, my reasons for joining your consulting firm are twofold. Number one, I think the

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,240
[Speaker 00] exposure to the strategy work is very appealing to me. And then second, the opportunities for

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,960
[Speaker 00] externship is also one that I am highly looking at. So on the strategy side, I know that

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,120
[Speaker 00] your consulting firm is one of the few that gives you exposure to C-suite executives

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
[Speaker 00] and to strategy type projects early on in your career, which is something that I won't

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,280
[Speaker 00] find at other companies. Then the second reason is the opportunity to do externships.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,800
[Speaker 00] So as I mentioned, I am interested in the education sector down the line and I know that

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,600
[Speaker 00] your company offers the opportunity to work for six months at a public sector type company

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,440
[Speaker 00] or a non-profit out in Africa focused on education. So I think those are some of

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,080
[Speaker 00] the things that highly appeal to me in your company.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,320
[Speaker 00] Okay, awesome, that's good to know. So now we'll dive into a little bit more

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,520
[Speaker 00] behavioral questions. So could you tell me about a time where you solved a difficult problem?

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
[Speaker 00] That's a good question. I think the moment that I can think of is when I was working

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,480
[Speaker 00] at the electrical power plant. We were trying to launch a new department and my task was to

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,520
[Speaker 00] essentially source a supplier. Typically we work with a supplier of generators from France,

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
[Speaker 00] but this time around their capacity and also their pricing did not match our budget and

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,480
[Speaker 00] what we were looking for. So what I ended up doing is I ended up creating a large list

32
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,560
[Speaker 00] of all the different suppliers that are out there and then I found a supplier in South Korea that

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,200
[Speaker 00] I negotiated with and also was able to bring them in and implement all of the new generator

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,400
[Speaker 00] technology. So that was able to save us a total cost of 10% from the total project

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
[Speaker 00] and it was a huge success at the end of it.

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,560
[Speaker 00] Awesome, thank you for sharing that. So next, could you tell me about like one or two of

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,160
[Speaker 00] your key strengths? So I would say the biggest two would probably be my ability to persuade

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,760
[Speaker 00] people and then the second would be leadership. I would say those are the biggest two.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,320
[Speaker 00] Okay, so could you dive a little bit more into that first one? Your ability to persuade people,

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,240
[Speaker 00] maybe tell me about a time you were able to convince someone to change their mind?

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,600
[Speaker 00] Yeah, so what I can think of is when I was working at Amazon, one of the big projects that

42
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,480
[Speaker 00] we're trying to launch is the first new robotic facility, but it came out a time when COVID

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,440
[Speaker 00] had just hit and I was unable to essentially source a lot of the material that we typically

44
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,240
[Speaker 00] get from our Japanese supplier. So the vice president of supply chain at the time,

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,720
[Speaker 00] his executive decision was to push the launch and push it out for a few months.

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,680
[Speaker 00] Instead, what I decided to do is try to see if there's a way to still keep the launch at the

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,000
[Speaker 00] same time and I looked at some of our existing facilities already and try to source some

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
[Speaker 00] of the unused material from there so that we don't delay the launch. So initially the

49
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,000
[Speaker 00] VP of supply chain wanted to delay the launch, but through the analysis,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
[Speaker 00] through explaining to him that we could source it from the other facilities,

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
[Speaker 00] I was able to convince him to not delay the launch and instead change the strategy to still be able

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
[Speaker 01] to get the facility right out on time. Okay, great. So now we'll dive into that second

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,520
[Speaker 00] strength you had mentioned. Could you tell me about a time that you demonstrated strong

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,960
[Speaker 00] leadership skills? Yeah, the one that I can think of is when I was working at the Boston

55
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,440
[Speaker 00] Consulting Group. There I was leading a big real estate occupancy project,

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,680
[Speaker 00] where I wanted to essentially showcase what the attendance of each office looked like.

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
[Speaker 00] What I had to do was then automate the process for a lot of the partners so that they have

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,800
[Speaker 00] like a dashboard that they can like manipulate and change and look at the data.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,720
[Speaker 00] So I had to work with a large team of 15 different developers, software engineers

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
[Speaker 00] and data engineers. So I worked with them to essentially gather the data,

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,880
[Speaker 00] clean the data and process it and put it and visualize it through Tableau.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,320
[Speaker 00] So that was a great opportunity where I was essentially working with different teams,

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,320
[Speaker 00] putting game plans, putting timelines for them. And as I mentioned at the end of it,

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
[Speaker 00] it was a very strong project and the partners were very happy with the dashboard.

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,960
[Speaker 00] And it was a good like managerial experience for me at the time as well.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,040
[Speaker 00] Awesome, that sounds like a very worthwhile experience. So now that we've talked a little

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,840
[Speaker 00] bit about your strengths, maybe you could tell me about a weakness that you face in the workforce.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
[Speaker 00] Yeah, I'd say the biggest one is probably my ability to prioritize when there's a lot of

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,880
[Speaker 00] conflicting and competing priorities. The big one in that case would be when say there's

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,400
[Speaker 00] three or four different projects and all of them are high urgency or high priority.

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,320
[Speaker 00] Sometimes as someone who's still very junior in their career, I still don't have that business

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
[Speaker 00] sense on which one I should tackle first. But I've been trying to improve on it and work on

73
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,480
[Speaker 00] it. So what I do now is I typically just chat with my manager and try to understand

74
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,560
[Speaker 00] where the business focus should be. And sometimes even just directly ask on how I

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,320
[Speaker 00] should prioritize some of the work. So I have been improving on that a little bit.

76
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
[Speaker 00] And I think with some seniority, I'll hopefully be able to get there and understand what I should

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,280
[Speaker 00] start with first. Okay, definitely makes sense. So those are all the questions that I had for you

78
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,760
[Speaker 00] today. Before we end, do you have any questions for me? Yeah, I think I have two big questions.

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,800
[Speaker 00] I think the first one is, as you know, there's a lot of big push for like the remote workforce

80
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,640
[Speaker 00] right now. And as a consulting company, there's a lot of work working directly with

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,320
[Speaker 00] clients or coming in in person to visit the clients. Do you think that the consulting

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,280
[Speaker 00] business model would necessarily change now that we're are in a remote environment? I think

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,440
[Speaker 00] that's a big one. And then the second question that I had for you is, what are the kind of the

84
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,240
[Speaker 00] big goals of your consulting company by say 2025? What are the big milestones that you guys are

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
[Speaker 00] hoping to achieve? And is say international expansion, one of those big milestones that

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,040
[Speaker 00] you're looking at? Great. So I think Zia did an amazing job with that interview. There are

87
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,320
[Speaker 00] four main things that I think he did really well. First, he was very poised and confident

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,720
[Speaker 00] throughout the entire interview. We were going back and forth and I was asking him a lot of

89
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,560
[Speaker 00] questions, but he came back very prepared for each question. Second, he used the star method

90
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,560
[Speaker 00] very well. I could really understand the situation, task, action and result. And he

91
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,440
[Speaker 00] introduced each story in a way that made me understand what he was saying. Third,

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,120
[Speaker 00] he was very concise in each of his stories. And lastly, he ended with some very thoughtful

93
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
[Speaker 00] questions that made it seem like he really cared about the company and the position.

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,360
[Speaker 00] Overall, Zia did a great job and I would accelerate him to the next round.
