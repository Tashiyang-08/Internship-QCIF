Hello Chloe, I'm Andy Davis, I'm HR Manager and I'm a Chair of the Panel. My colleagues

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,680
will introduce themselves. Hi, I'm Ian Mullinsen, Head of Health and Safety. Hi Chloe, Jenna

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,920
Bootman, HR Advisor. Please take a seat Chloe. I've already brought you some water, but

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,400
if you need any more as we go through, please just let me know and I can get you some more.

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,640
Thank you. No problem. Chloe, the purpose of the interview today is so we can find out

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,320
a little bit more about you in order to decide who to appoint. We have prepared some questions

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,200
and all the panel members will be asking questions as we go through. There's no trick

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,680
questions in this, they're all about you so you should be able to answer them. Clearly

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,680
we will be assessing against elements on the person specification and at the end

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,520
of the interview I will give you an opportunity to ask us questions. That's great, very

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,520
clear. Thank you. No problem. So okay, the first question is from me, so can you explain

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
to me what first attracted you to this post? Well I've been in the same role now for about

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,680
three years and whilst I've been there I feel I've acquired a lot of skills and I'd

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,160
like to put these to good use. Okay, you mentioned the skills that you'd acquired

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,840
in your previous role. Could you explain to me what skills that you think you'd

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,720
be able to transfer into this role? Yes, I've got good organisational skills.

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,720
I've also assisted in organising stock orders and I've also helped out when

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,720
organising the casual staff rotors. Brilliant, thanks very much. Good communication

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,520
skills are an integral part of this role as is completing paperwork and various

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
bits of constituent interaction. Can you demonstrate your written and

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,240
verbal communication skills? Yes, I have a C in GCSE English and also

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,400
as part of my NVQ I've had to complete written assignments. In my current role I

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,440
have interaction with customers on a daily basis so I understand the need for

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,160
good communication and also for treating people the way that I would like to be

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,920
treating myself. Absolutely, thank you. And could you give me an example of when

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,600
you worked as part of a team and to achieve a particular goal?

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,160
Do you want me to repeat the question? My mind's gone blank, sorry. I'm just

28
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,600
struggling to think of an example. It's okay. Not a problem. Think about your

29
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,680
current role. Do you work as part of a team there? Yes, particularly at busy

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,880
times we all dig in to get the jobs done that we need to even if

31
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,960
it means doing the tasks that I wouldn't necessarily normally do. That's great.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,640
Thank you. Have you ever had to deal with a difficult customer or a

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,040
customer complaint? Yes, there was an occasion where I dealt with a difficult

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,240
customer. She put in a complaint because of the amount of time it had taken to

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,880
get served. I had apologised for it and I explained the reason why it had

36
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,920
taken so long. After I dealt with the customer I did report it to the

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,240
supervisor so that she could look at the staffing levels at peak times.

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,680
Okay, thank you. That sounds great. Thank you. I think that's the end of our

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,640
questions now. But as promised, do you have any questions for us? Yes, would I be

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,400
required to work at weekends? Well, yes. As outlined in the person

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,920
specification and the advert, the role requires five days in any seven

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
for work. So obviously that does include some weekends. What we'd want to

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,920
do is absolutely agree those days with the successful candidate. Okay, that's

44
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,120
great. Thank you. No problem at all. Well, thanks for attending the

45
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
interview. We've obviously got a few other people to see today so we're

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,160
hoping to bring the successful candidate tomorrow. Which would be the best

47
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,080
number to get you on? Is it your work or your mobile number? The mobile

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,680
number would be the better one. If I don't answer then I'll be able to

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,440
call you back in my bike. Yeah, no problem at all. We understand that

50
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,440
that can be a bit difficult. But thanks so much for coming in. Thank you.

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Cheers. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Bye.
