Okay, Jane, now tell me a little about yourself.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I went to the University of California, and majored in graphic design. I started my career at a marketing company. I worked there about two years. Now, I want to work in a progressive company, with more creative members.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Great. So where do you see yourself, in next five years?

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In five years, I see myself as a valued employee of this company. I want to be an expert, at my position, and start training to be a manager. Also my goal is to become a lead in five years. Although, not everyone gets promoted to this level, I believe, I can achieve this goal through hard work.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What does success mean, to you Jane?

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Success means, to achieve a goal I have set for myself. Success means, to produce high quality work, before the deadline.

30
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Nice answer. Can you work well, under pressure?

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I enjoy working under pressure, because I believe, it helps me grow. In my previous experience, I always worked well, during deadlines, and I always learned, how to work more efficiently afterwards.

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, how do you make important decisions?

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I gather all the information, I can find and based on the information, I'll come to the best decision I can. If I know a co-worker was in a similar situation, I wouldn't hesitate to find out the results, to make sure my decision is the best one.

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
